==============

Python exercises for [CDL students](http://cdl.rosedu.org/2014/#acasa) taken from [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/).

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10lZyWTD_LPKHhQbQFfUnoe2Ng45K89wTlyFxXJkQuMU/edit#slide=id.g1ce35f271_35)

The course takes two hours. The plan is:

* first present Python specific stuff
* code the first program
* code the first function (they should code along)
* explain in the terminal strings
* leave them 20 mins for string1.py (and 2 if you have time)
* next chapters
* finally go for a hands-on on OOP, and give them the Codeacademy exercises
